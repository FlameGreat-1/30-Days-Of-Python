# Day 5 Challenge: Working with CSV and Excel Files

## Topics:
1. Introduction to CSV and Excel file formats
2. Reading and writing CSV files using the `csv` module
3. Working with Excel files using `openpyxl`
4. Data manipulation and analysis with `pandas`
5. Error handling and data validation

## Detailed Topic Breakdown:

### 1. Introduction to CSV and Excel file formats
- Understanding the structure of CSV files
- Overview of Excel file format and its components
- Importance of these formats in data analysis and storage

### 2. Reading and writing CSV files using the `csv` module
- Opening and reading CSV files
- Writing data to CSV files
- Handling different delimiters and quoting options
- Using `DictReader` and `DictWriter` for named columns

### 3. Working with Excel files using `openpyxl`
- Installing and importing `openpyxl`
- Reading Excel workbooks and sheets
- Writing data to Excel files
- Manipulating cells, rows, and columns
- Formatting and styling Excel sheets

### 4. Data manipulation and analysis with `pandas`
- Introduction to `pandas` for data analysis
- Reading CSV and Excel files with `pandas`
- Basic data manipulation operations
- Exporting data to CSV and Excel formats

### 5. Error handling and data validation
- Handling file I/O exceptions
- Dealing with missing or corrupt data
- Implementing data validation techniques

## Exercises:

1. Create a CSV file with sample data (e.g., student records) and write a Python script to read and display its contents.

2. Write a program that takes user input to create a simple spreadsheet (e.g., a budget tracker) and saves it as an Excel file.

3. Read a CSV file containing sales data, calculate total sales and average sale value, then write the results to a new CSV file.

4. Create an Excel file with multiple sheets, each containing different types of data (e.g., employee information, sales data). Write a script to read this file and print a summary of each sheet.

5. Use `pandas` to read a large CSV file (you can generate sample data), perform some basic analysis (e.g., calculate mean, median, mode of a column), and export the results to both CSV and Excel formats.

## Advanced Assignment: Data Analysis and Reporting Tool

### Objective:
Create a comprehensive data analysis and reporting tool that can handle both CSV and Excel files, perform various data manipulations, and generate insightful reports.

### Requirements:

1. File Handling:
   - Implement functions to read and write both CSV and Excel files
   - Handle potential errors and exceptions gracefully

2. Data Processing:
   - Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, data type conversions)
   - Implement functions for basic statistical analysis (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
   - Create functions for data aggregation and grouping

3. Data Visualization:
   - Generate basic charts and graphs using a library like matplotlib or seaborn
   - Save visualizations as images and embed them in Excel reports

4. Reporting:
   - Create a function to generate a comprehensive Excel report with multiple sheets:
     - Summary statistics
     - Processed data
     - Charts and graphs
   - Implement cell formatting and styling for better readability

5. User Interface:
   - Create a command-line interface for users to:
     - Select input files (CSV or Excel)
     - Choose analysis options
     - Specify output formats and locations

6. Advanced Features:
   - Implement data validation for input files
   - Add support for handling large datasets efficiently
   - Include options for custom data transformations

### Bonus Challenge:
Extend the tool to support merging data from multiple input files based on a common key.

## Notes:
- Pay attention to code organization and modularity
- Use appropriate error handling and input validation
- Document your code thoroughly with comments and docstrings
- Consider performance implications when working with large datasets
- Test your program with various input scenarios to ensure robustness
