    "Day 5 Challenge: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction to OOP\n",
    "   - What is OOP?\n",
    "   - Benefits of OOP\n",
    "   - OOP vs Procedural Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classes and Objects\n",
    "   - Defining a class\n",
    "   - Creating objects (instances)\n",
    "   - Class attributes vs instance attributes\n",
    "   - The `self` parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Methods\n",
    "   - Instance methods\n",
    "   - Class methods (using `@classmethod` decorator)\n",
    "   - Static methods (using `@staticmethod` decorator)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Constructors and Destructors\n",
    "   - `__init__` method\n",
    "   - `__del__` method\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Encapsulation\n",
    "   - Public, private, and protected attributes\n",
    "   - Getter and setter methods\n",
    "   - Property decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Inheritance\n",
    "   - Single inheritance\n",
    "   - Multiple inheritance\n",
    "   - Method overriding\n",
    "   - The `super()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Polymorphism\n",
    "   - Method overloading (function overloading in Python)\n",
    "   - Method overriding\n",
    "   - Duck typing\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Abstract Base Classes and Interfaces\n",
    "   - `abc` module\n",
    "   - Abstract methods\n",
    "   - Concrete methods in abstract classes\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Advanced OOP Concepts\n",
    "   - Composition vs Inheritance\n",
    "   - Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
    "   - Mixins\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Class Creation:\n",
    "   Create a `Person` class with attributes for name, age, and address. Include methods to update these attributes and a method to print a person's details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bank Account System:\n",
    "   Implement a `BankAccount` class with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance. Include proper error handling for insufficient funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Shape Hierarchy:\n",
    "   Create a base `Shape` class and derive classes like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`. Implement methods to calculate area and perimeter for each shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Employee Management System:\n",
    "   Design a system with classes for `Employee`, `Manager`, and `Executive`. Use inheritance to represent the hierarchy. Include methods for calculating salaries, assigning tasks, and generating reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Library Management System:\n",
    "   Create classes for `Book`, `Library`, and `Member`. Implement methods for checking out books, returning books, and managing library inventory. Use composition to represent the relationship between `Library` and `Book`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Polymorphism Exercise:\n",
    "   Create a `Vehicle` base class and derive classes like `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Truck`. Implement a `start_engine()` method in each class that behaves differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Abstract Class Implementation:\n",
    "   Design an abstract `Animal` class with abstract methods like `speak()` and `move()`. Create concrete classes like `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird` that implement these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Advanced OOP Project: E-Commerce System\n",
    "   Develop a comprehensive e-commerce system that demonstrates mastery of OOP concepts. Include the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `Product` class with attributes like name, price, and inventory\n",
    "   - `User` class with subclasses for `Customer` and `Admin`\n",
    "   - `ShoppingCart` class that can hold multiple products\n",
    "   - `Order` class to process and track customer orders\n",
    "   - `PaymentProcessor` abstract class with concrete implementations for different payment methods\n",
    "   - `InventoryManager` class to handle stock updates\n",
    "   - Implement appropriate relationships (inheritance, composition) between classes\n",
    "   - Use encapsulation to protect sensitive data (e.g., payment information)\n",
    "   - Implement polymorphic behavior where appropriate (e.g., payment processing)\n",
    "   - Include proper error handling and input validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Focus on writing clean, readable, and well-documented code\n",
    "- Use meaningful variable and method names\n",
    "- Practice proper indentation and code organization\n",
    "- Implement error handling where appropriate\n",
    "- Think about real-world analogies to understand OOP concepts better\n",
    "- Don't hesitate to refactor your code as you learn new concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Resources:\n",
    "- Python Official Documentation on Classes: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html\n",
    "- Real Python's OOP in Python 3: https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/\n",
    "- \"Python Object-Oriented Programming\" by Dusty Phillips (book)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to test your code thoroughly and experiment with different scenarios. OOP is a powerful paradigm, and mastering it will significantly enhance your Python programming skills. Good luck with your Day 5 challenge!\n"
