## Exercises

1. **Advanced Filtering**: Given a DataFrame of employee data, select all employees who are either in the 'IT' department with a salary > 60000, or in the 'HR' department with a salary > 50000.

2. **Data Transformation**: Use apply() to create a new column that categorizes employees into 'Junior', 'Senior', or 'Expert' based on their years of experience and performance score.

3. **GroupBy and Aggregation**: Group a sales DataFrame by 'Region' and 'Product', then calculate the total sales, average sale price, and count of transactions for each group.

4. **Missing Data Handling**: In a time series DataFrame of stock prices, use an appropriate interpolation method to fill missing values, considering the nature of stock price movements.

5. **DataFrame Merging**: Merge three DataFrames containing customer information, order details, and product information to create a comprehensive order summary DataFrame.

6. **Time Series Analysis**: Resample a DataFrame of hourly temperature readings to daily averages, then calculate a 7-day rolling mean.

7. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize a function that processes a large DataFrame by implementing vectorization and appropriate data types.

## Advanced Assignment: E-commerce Data Analysis Project

### Objective
Develop a comprehensive e-commerce data analysis tool using advanced Pandas operations. This project will simulate real-world data analysis tasks that data scientists often encounter in e-commerce companies.

### Dataset
You will be provided with the following datasets:
1. `customers.csv`: Customer information (ID, name, email, registration date)
2. `products.csv`: Product catalog (ID, name, category, price)
3. `orders.csv`: Order details (order ID, customer ID, order date, product ID, quantity)
4. `website_traffic.csv`: Daily website traffic data (date, page views, unique visitors)

### Tasks

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Load all datasets into Pandas DataFrames
   - Handle missing values appropriately
   - Convert data types as needed (e.g., dates to datetime objects)

2. **Customer Analysis**
   - Calculate customer lifetime value (total amount spent by each customer)
   - Identify the top 10% of customers by purchase frequency
   - Analyze customer registration trends over time

3. **Product Analysis**
   - Determine the best-selling products by quantity and by revenue
   - Calculate the average order value for each product category
   - Identify products often purchased together (market basket analysis)

4. **Order Trends**
   - Analyze daily, weekly, and monthly order trends
   - Calculate the average time between orders for each customer
   - Identify any seasonality in order patterns

5. **Website Traffic Analysis**
   - Correlate website traffic data with daily order volumes
   - Calculate conversion rates (orders per unique visitor)
   - Identify peak traffic times and their relation to sales

6. **Cohort Analysis**
   - Group customers into cohorts based on registration month
   - Analyze the purchasing behavior of different cohorts over time

7. **Reporting and Visualization**
   - Create a summary DataFrame with key metrics
   - Generate at least 3 insightful visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn
   - Write a brief report interpreting your findings

### Requirements
- Use advanced Pandas operations covered in today's lesson
- Optimize your code for performance when dealing with large datasets
- Properly document your code with comments and docstrings
- Handle errors gracefully and include data validation where appropriate

### Bonus Challenges
- Implement a function to forecast future sales using time series analysis
- Create a customer segmentation model using K-means clustering
- Develop a simple recommendation system based on purchase history
